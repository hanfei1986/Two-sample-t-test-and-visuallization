# Two-sample-t-test-and-visuallization
Two-sample t-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine if there is a significant difference between two independent groups. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (for example 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the groups.
